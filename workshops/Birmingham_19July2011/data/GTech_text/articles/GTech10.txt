The cable, TV and phone company's total revenue grew 5.7% to 982m in the first quarter. The key analyst metric of average revenue per user climbed 2.6% year-on-year to 46.16, although this represented a fall from the record 47.51 reported in the fourth quarter. Overall, Virgin Media added 20,200 customers in the first quarter, a 47% drop on the 38,300 signed up in the same period last year. The company's total subscriber base is 4.82m. "Triple play" customers those taking three products from Virgin grew slightly to 63.4% of the subscriber base. "Quad play" customers grew to 12% of the total. Within its total customer base Virgin was able to sign up 50,100 new customers to its broadband in the first quarter again down on the 72,300 in the same period last year with 39% of new customers taking 20Mb or higher speeds. A year ago just 15% signed up for high speed packages. Virgin Media's TV base increased by just 10,100 in the first quarter, taking the total number of subscribers to 3.78m. Of these, more than 1.5m have high definition the company added 66,400 new HD customers in the fourth quarter. The company said that there has been "strong early interest" in its next generation home entertainment service powered by TiVo. A total of 65,000 customers have pre-registered for the new TV service. Virgin Media's chief financial officer, Eamonn O'Hare, brushed off the significance of low number of new customer additions. "You could look at the 10,000 figure and say 'that's not good', it is rather anaemic, but you need to look under the covers and it is the quality of customer that is the focus," he said. "When you look at the uptake of HD, video-on-demand and high speed broadband services, the quality of customer is ever increasing." O'Hare pointed to the financial health of the company with free cash flow doubling year-on-year to 100m. "The secret ingredient to our FCF, which is what our shareholders are looking for, is the richness of our customer base," he said. "We don't chase any old Joe up or down the street." He added that Virgin Media's share price is up 60% on 12 months ago. Virgin Media said there had been 22% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of the number of customers taking its Sky premium suite of channels, taking the total to about 800,000. O'Hare added that Virgin was no closer to securing a deal to air Sky Atlantic on its service. "It is not a must have and it is not a must not have," he said. "It is not something sitting on our immediate priority board." The company said that it will begin trials of a 1.5Gbps service, what it claims is the world's fastest, at a site near Old Street in London dubbed the "Silicon Roundabout". The trial is being conducted with four companies in the creative industries sector. "This has been another solid quarter where we have maintained strong levels of revenue growth and generated substantial free cash flow," said Neil Berkett, chief executive of Virgin Media. "Our 1.5Gb broadband trial will achieve the fastest cable speeds in the world and, by pushing the frontiers of technology, it will help us to understand the kinds of services our customers may need in the future and the exciting possibilities of an increasingly converged world." In Virgin's mobile phone division, contract customers rose by 52,600 to 1.26m with revenues up to 3.8% to 136.9m in the quarter
